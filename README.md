Walmart Retail Sales and Inventory Analysis
This project performs a detailed Retail Sales and Inventory Analysis for Walmart using Python, SQL(inside Python using SQLite), and Tableau.  
The objective is to understand sales patterns, analyze inventory performance, identify stockout risks, and create powerful visualizations for business insights.


 Project Highlights:
	•	Monthly total quantity sold analysis
	•	Monthly sales by product category
	•	Forecasted vs Actual Demand comparison
	•	Monthly Forecast Error calculation
	•	Inventory Reorder Point calculation using daily demand and supplier lead time
	•	Inventory Health Status classification
	•	Stockout Indicator Analysis
	•	Revenue Analysis (by month, by store, and by region)
	•	Identification of Best Selling and Most Profitable Products
	•	Tableau Dashboard integrating all key metrics



Tools and Technologies Used:
	•	Python: Pandas, Matplotlib
	•	SQL: SQLite (executed inside Python)
	•	Tableau Public: For interactive dashboards and storytelling
	•	Jupyter Notebook: For data preparation, SQL queries, and visualizations

Key Insights:
	•	Monthly Total Quantity Sold: Identified monthly sales trends across different product categories.
	•	Forecasted vs Actual Demand Analysis: Overlaid Forecasted vs Actual sales data to identify forecasting mismatches.
	•	Forecast Error Metrics: Calculated MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE to assess forecast accuracy.
	•	Inventory Health Status: Classified products into Overstocked, Optimal, and Understocked groups based on inventory levels and reorder points.
	•	Stockout Risk Analysis: Measured stockout incidents to improve product availability strategies.
	•	Revenue Analysis: Tracked monthly revenue growth, best-selling products, and revenue contribution by store and region.
	•	SQL Inside Python: Used SQL queries embedded within Python (SQLite) for data aggregation, transformation, and performance optimization before visualization.
